## Parallel agents
The ParallelAgent is a workflow agent that executes its sub-agents concurrently. This dramatically speeds up workflows where tasks can be performed independently.

Use ParallelAgent when: For scenarios prioritizing speed and involving independent, resource-intensive tasks, a ParallelAgent facilitates efficient parallel execution. When sub-agents operate without dependencies, their tasks can be performed concurrently, significantly reducing overall processing time.

As with other workflow agents, the ParallelAgent is not powered by an LLM, and is thus deterministic in how it executes. That being said, workflow agents are only concerned with their execution (i.e. executing sub-agents in parallel), and not their internal logic; the tools or sub-agents of a workflow agent may or may not utilize LLMs.
